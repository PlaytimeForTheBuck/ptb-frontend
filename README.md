### Jekyll front site generator for Playtime For The Buck

This is the repo that contains the actual code for PlaytimeForTheBuck.com

Jekyll, Jekyll-assets, CoffeeScript and SASS. Didn't use HAML because it didn't seem to worth the hassle at the time, specially because if I use it, it gets mixed with the Liquid templates and looks awful. Maybe I'm gonna migrate in the future if I feel like it, or just move from Jekylls to another static site builder, who knows.

There is not much to say about this repo.
