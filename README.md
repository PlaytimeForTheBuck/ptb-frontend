Inspired by the essence of this project I created [GGFilter.com](http://ggfilter.com/), which have similar goals of helping you find games, but with a greater scope and infrastructure.

### Site generator for PlaytimeForTheBuck

This is the repo that contains the actual code for [PlaytimeForTheBuck.zequez.com](http://playtimeforthebuck.zequez.com) (site was moved from PlaytimeForTheBuck.com).

Jekyll, Jekyll-assets, CoffeeScript and SASS. Didn't use HAML because it didn't seem to worth the hassle at the time, specially because if I use it, it gets mixed with the Liquid templates and looks awful. Maybe I'm gonna migrate in the future if I feel like it, or just move from Jekylls to another static site builder, who knows.

I could keep talking about what is here, but better you just go to the website.
